### Project Topic
<hr/>
Covid 19 growth simulation, impact of remedial measures and comparison with SARS outbreak of 2003. 

### Basic Information
<hr/>
Covid 19 growth simulation will be done based on the following conditions:<br/>
1. The R-factor and K-Factor of disease.<br/>
2. The usage and effectiveness of masks.<br/>
3. The prevalence of testing and contact tracing.<br/>
4. The availability and efficacy of the vaccine.<br/>
5. Any barriers to entry (including quarantine) into the subject area. <br/>

### Goals/Requirements
<hr/>
1. Worst case growth of created algorithm.<br/>
2. Explanation of invariant and entropy.<br/>
3. Comparison with SARS 2003 virus.<br/>
4. Unit testing<br/>
